# dart RGB hex

This is a small thing that basically converts RGB values to hexadecimal values,
you can use it with flutter or dart.

## Using it

clone the repo and just import it

```dart
import 'rgb.dart'

// use it
rgbToHex( 200, 200, 200 ); // outputs #C8C8C8
```

## Tests

If you want to run the tests, first run this to get the test dependency:

```dart
dart pub get
```

Then

```dart
dart test testRGB.dart
```

I would recommend reading [this](https://pub.dev/packages/test) this if you want to get more into testing :)

and reading the [Effective Dart](https://dart.dev/guides/language/effective-dart/documentation) for writing documentation.
